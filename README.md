## Berkeley-Module11 - Car Price Prediction - What factors make a car more or less expensive

#Overview**
The project The project aims to determine whether a customer will accept a driving coupon using visualizations and probability distributions. It requires completing the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook.
Problem Statement Summary
The project explores the decision-making process of drivers when they receive a coupon on their phone for a nearby venue, such as a restaurant, bar, or coffee house. It examines whether drivers would use the coupon immediately, save it for later, or ignore it altogether. The study considers various influencing factors, including the type of venue, the presence of a passenger, weather conditions, time of day, and proximity to the venue. The primary goal is to understand the factors that drive coupon acceptance and develop a predictive model for coupon usage behavior.

Learning Outcome

The assignment focuses on applying exploratory data analysis, plotting, statistical summarization, and data visualization skills to a machine learning problem.
Data

The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. It includes various driving scenarios and asks respondents if they would accept a coupon as a driver. Responses are categorized as:

"Right away" or "Later, before the coupon expires" (Y = 1)
"No, I do not want the coupon" (Y = 0)
The survey covers five types of coupons: less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20â€“$50).
